# Lab4

Turn in one copy for each group. If group members are not present in class they will be required to complete their own lab to receive credit. Please turn in **both an WORD or PDF file and your R Markdown script**. 

## Lab Overview

The entire lab will be worth 20 points. Clarity of code, including comments and interpretable variables names, along with thoughtful writing with an emphasis on concise interpretations will be important. 

## Questions
Answer the following questions in this R Markdown document. Please include code where necessary.

### 1. Yahtzee
#### a. (5 points)
Implement a Monte Carlo procedure to estimate the probability of rolling a Yahtzee (5 dice all with the same value).


#### b (5 points)
Suppose that you have currently rolled `1, 3, 3, 6, 4`. If you keep the pair of 3's and re-roll the other three dice, what is the probability of rolling a Yahtzee?


### 2. Black-Jack
#### a. (5 points)
Implement a procedure to estimate the probability of being dealt black-jack (2 cards that total 21). If you are unfamiliar with black jack, wikipedia provides a nice overview.


#### b. (5 points)
Assume you have been dealt the 10 of hearts and the 4 of diamonds and the dealer has a 6 showing. By standard rules, you win if your card total is higher than the dealer, but less than or equal to 21. You have the option to *hit* which means adding more cards to your total, but if you go over 21 you **bust** and automatically lose.

Describe in words how you would simulate this process to estimate the probability of winning by hitting and staying.
